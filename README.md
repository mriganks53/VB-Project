# VB-Project

In this project, we have created a user interface (UI) using PyQt5 Designer. For the database, we utilized SQLite, and to enable multi-user functionality, we implemented Flask. The UI is built with multiple stack widgets, and we have also populated data from one of our internal webpages, KIP.
